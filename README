meta-code-signing provides infrastructure for unifying access to keys on the
file system and HSMs.

This repository contains two layers:

meta-code-signing:
  A reusable layer providing signing.bbclass, which also contains some
  documentation. This could be upstreamed to meta-oe.

meta-code-signing-demo:
  qemu-based demo with signed fit image, dm-verity, rauc bundle and kernel
  modules.

A talk about this layer was held at OpenEmbedded Workshop 2023:
